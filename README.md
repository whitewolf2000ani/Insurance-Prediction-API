# Insurance-Prediction-API

A production-grade API for **predicting the premium category of a patient** based on demographic and lifestyle information. This project lets insurance companies, brokers, or developers seamlessly integrate robust premium estimation capabilities into their workflows.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Accurate **premium prediction** using trained machine learning models.
- Predicts premium category based on commonly used attributes: age, height, weight, Income in LPA, city tier, smoking status, City, Occupation.
- Customizable pipeline to retrain or update the model with new data.

---

## üè• Use Cases

- **Insurance companies**: Quick premium estimation for new applicants.
- **Healthcare apps**: Quote simulation for patients or users.
- **Developers/Students**: Experiment and learn about deploying ML models as APIs.

---

## üìä Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Model:** *[List the algorithms you used, e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.]*  
- **Deployment:** Pending will be using Docker

## üõ† API Endpoints

| Endpoint   | Method | Description                       |
|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `/predict` | POST   | Predicts insurance premium category|
| `/health`  | GET    | Health status of the API           |

### Example request:
```json
POST /predict
{
"age": 35,
"weight":75,
"height":1.25,
"income_lpa":10,
"smoker": "yes",
"city": "Kolkata",
"occupation":"retired"
}
```

### Example response:
```json
{
  "response": {
    "predicted_category": "Medium",
    "confidence": 0.49,
    "class_probablities": {
      "High": 0.29,
      "Low": 0.22,
      "Medium": 0.49
    }
  }
}
```

## üß† Model Details

- **Features used:** Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region  
- **Model selection:** Random Forest Classifier is implemented in Python via the scikit-learn library. This algorithm combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, each trained on different random subsets of your data and features. For classification tasks, the final prediction is decided by a majority vote among all the decision trees in the forest.
- **Evaluation:** Confidence Scores, Class Probabilites
